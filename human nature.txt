humanity , virtue, altruism , kindness what is this? i guess this can be counted only when someone does with selflessness.
humanity differ from a mere justice in that there is a level of altruism towards individuals included in humanity more so than the fairness found in justice. that is humanity and the 
acts of love, altruism, and social intellegence are typically individual strengths while fairness is generally expanded to all.
 to me humanity is not not as good as its said. religions does various evil in the name of humanity. they use it as cover, they sheild their bad doings , fullfil their own
selfish dream . its not like this is happening newly its been going like this from ages. people does good deeds to show others. if you are doing something in expectation of something
in return , you better stop, because this is where you lost. everyone known in there heart if their conscience is clear or not.
if you can't be kind then don't pretend to be. its better to hate openly then betraying.
sometimes evil is the result of humane , being immersed in the ocean of humanity , not able to see clearly what's wrong and right, that one wrong decision makes one to lost the trust, 
forces one to choose the only path left.
in fact all of us have a dark side. this dark side includes qualities we don't dare reveal to others. but embracing these negative qualities actually opens the door to happiness
, fullfilment and true enlightment according to debbie ford in her book the dark side of the light chasers.

there is still a lot of thought, a lot going in my mind, its just i can't gather all of my emotion and feeling and put it on paper.
